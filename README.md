# ELAN-API
API to Autonomics Media Streamer

I wrote this as a wrapper to the Autonomics Media Streamer. Initially I wrote it with Telnet commands and then later called into the REST APIs.

It takes a Public IP address for your streamer, a room, an artist and whether you want Pandora or Spotify and then it turns on the correct speaker and the 
appropriate music service, Pandora or Spotify,.
